# phantomFuncUnitPlugin

## Dependencies

 * (PhantomJS)[http://http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/Installation] - Tested and working fine with version 1.5.
 * Xvfb - if you plan to run the plugin on a machine without X (i.e. a CI server)

## Configuration
There's really not much to configure, however you can change the location of your js tests by editing phantomFuncUnit.yml in the plugin's config directory.


## Usage

To run all javascript tests:

  ./symfony phantomFuncUnit:run

To run a specific javascript test (e.g. a test suite at test/funcunit/moduleName/testA.js)

  ./symfony phantomFuncUnit:run moduleName/testA

To generate a JUnit xml:

  ./symfony phantomFuncUnit:run --xml=log/funcunit_tests.xml


## Notes for running on Hudson

 * Make sure to run `export DISPLAY=:0` before running your funcunit tests on a machine with no X but with xvfb installed.
   (This should be run on every hudson build.)

 * You may have to make hudson an xuser if it tells you it can't find a display at :0 - `xhost +local:hudson`
